  - This is why we're now *compiling* our Websites
  - Web evolved, we build on strong fondations, but need top-level tools
- The 2021 Web Building Pipeline
  - Create app from CLI
  - Scafold components
  - then
    - Require modules/tools/libs/helpers
    - Add Routing/Store/... parts
    - Go to step 2
    - Be mad at tools configuration
    - Finally get something working
    - Enrich the project
    - Hire a dedicated team to Operations
    - Still wait 5' each time you save a file
      (kidding but...)
  - We intended to make developers life easier
    but our devtools stack is overly complex
  - If we *compile*, nothing should force us to go through the whole pipeline when in the dev process
  - Improving the Developer eXperience
    - Standardized ESM
    - Superset of languages (TS, JSX...)
    - Free from loading the whole NPM Registry locally
    - Instant Startup!
    - Built-in HMR support
    - Extensible
    - Focusing on dev, launching on prod
- Solving the bottleneck: the bare-modules dev trend
  - How it works?
    - Use native modules support in the Browser
    - transform non-JS modules to ES
    - cache modules generation
    - use HMR to re-inject updated content
    - Rely on HTTP(/2)

  - The Treeshaking mystery
  - Extending the build (plugins)
- Who Controls the past now controls the Future
- It's a new exciting *war* between great actors (Skypack, Vue, Preact...)
- ESM oriented Registries: Skypack, esm.sh, jspm
- Plug it to your existing project
